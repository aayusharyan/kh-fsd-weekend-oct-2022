## Introduction about the Educator

## Web Development

### Website
- It is piece of software which is built for the browser.
- We open a URL (http://www.google.com) and the browser shows the Google search page.


### What happens when you open google.com
- Browser will send a request to the google servers saying I want to access the homepage.
- Servers will process that request and prepare the response.
- This response is sent back to the browesr.
- The browser will execute this code and show the output to the user (The google search page that we see).


### Web Development Industry
- Everyone needs a website.
- Many oragnizations need multiple websites (not public use but for internal purposes).
- Everyone might not say they want a web developer, but everone needs a web developer.
- MERN is not the only stack, but this is the THE most popular approach.
- Now, the JS language (which was initially to be used for browsers only) can be used for other things, example. mobile applications, desktop applications.


## History
- Frist website was about 30 years ago.
- Initially it was text only.

### Web 3.0
- Decentralized Internet.
- Things are stored on Blockchain and everyone has ownership of their data.

### Web 2.0
- This allowed interaction with the website.
- This opened the doors for Social Media.

### Web 1.0
- Most like a one way communication.
- Mostly Read-only.
- We could not interact wit those websites.

### WWW
- World Wide Web

### What is Internet
- A very vey very large network of computers which can communicate with each other.
- When we saw "I need internet", we are basically wanting to connect our device to this large global network.
- This allows us to open any website, interact with that just connect in general.
- Internet is not just website, a common part is what we see, but there are many other things as well.
- This is like the whole map of roadways. We can have all sorts of traffic on this, web traffic is just a part.

### Intranet
- This is a network which is private and within an organization.
- An internal network of computers.

### Browser
- This is a software. This is sometimes not built-in, we need to install it manually.
- This is used to open the websites and we based software.
- This can understand and process the output sent back by the server.
- The browser is also referred to as a client.
- Also as a `User-Agent`.

### User-Agent
- The browser is acting as an agent to the user.
- The user intends to open google.com. The browser will connect the server, make requests, process responses and show the final output on the screen.


### Different Browser
- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox 
- Edge
- Internet Explorer
- Opera
- Chromium
- Brave
- Electron
- Tor
- Netscape Browser
- Mosaic - This was the second browser, about 25-30 years ago.
- WWW Browser - This was the first browser,
- UC Browser
- Samsung Internet Browser

# Browser Contd.
- Browsers can only understand 3 major languages.
  - HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) - This gives structure to our content. HTML5
  - CSS - (Cascading StyleSheet) - This gives looks to the website. CSS3
  - JS - (JavaScript) - This gives Functionality to the website. JS-2019

## Request-Response Architecture / Client-Server Architecture / Request Response Cycle
- The client makes a request.
- Server acknowledged that request.
- Server prepares a response.
- Server sends that response back to the client.
- Client process that response.
